# Public Go API

There are no importable Go packages in this repository. 
- `cmd/` contains the main binary entry point.
- `internal/` contains all library logic (not importable by external modules).
- `main.go` is package `main`.

The Go component is designed exclusively as a private binary for the PHP wrapper.
